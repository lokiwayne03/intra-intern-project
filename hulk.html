            The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
            Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut 
            issue of The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). 
            
            Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick Jones during the 
            detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when 
            subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads to 
            destructive rampages and to conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's 
            level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger. 
            
            Originally, it was believed that Banner's transformations into the Hulk were caused by sunset 
            and undone at sunrise, but later, after Rick witnessed Banner turn into Hulk at daytime following 
            a failed attempt by Ross' men to shoot the Hulk into space, it was discovered to be caused by anger.
