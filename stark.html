        A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious 
        scientist, Anthony Edward Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. 
        When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead 
        creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark 
        develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his 
        company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man.
         
        Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself 
         to be Iron Man.
